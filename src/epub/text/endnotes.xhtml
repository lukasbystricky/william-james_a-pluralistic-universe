			<p id="id00419">Note 15, page 128.⁠—Judging by the analogy of the relation which our central consciousness seems to bear to that of our spinal cord, lower ganglia, etc., it would seem natural to suppose that in whatever superhuman mental synthesis there may be, the neglect and elimination of certain contents of which we are conscious on the human level might be as characteristic a feature as is the combination and interweaving of other human contents.</p>

			<p id="id00427">Note 2, page 184.⁠—<i>The World and the Individual</i>, vol. ii, pp. 58⁠–⁠62.</p>
			<p id="id00428">Note 3, page 190.⁠—I hold to it still as the best description of an enormous number of our higher fields of consciousness. They demonstrably do not <i>contain</i> the lower states that know the same objects. Of other fields, however this is not so true; so, in the <i>Psychological Review</i> for 1895, vol. ii, p. 105 (see especially pp. 119⁠–⁠120), I frankly withdrew, in principle, my former objection to talking of fields of consciousness being made of simpler “parts,” leaving the facts to decide the question in each special case.</p>
			<p id="id00429">Note 4, page 194.⁠—I abstract from the consciousness attached to the whole itself, if such consciousness be there.</p>
			<h4 id="id00430" style="margin-top: 2em">LECTURE VI</h4>
			<p id="id00431">Note 1, page 250.⁠—For a more explicit vindication of the notion of activity, see Appendix B, where I try to defend its recognition as a definite form of immediate experience against its rationalistic critics.</p>
			<p id="id00432">I subjoin here a few remarks destined to disarm some possible critics of Professor Bergson, who, to defend himself against misunderstandings of his meaning, ought to amplify and more fully explain his statement that concepts have a practical but not a theoretical use. Understood in one way, the thesis sounds indefensible, for by concepts we certainly increase our knowledge about things, and that seems a theoretical achievement, whatever practical achievements may follow in its train. Indeed, M. Bergson might seem to be easily refutable out of his own mouth. His philosophy pretends, if anything, to give a better insight into truth than rationalistic philosophies give: yet what is it in itself if not a conceptual system? Does its author not reason by concepts exclusively in his very attempt to show that they can give no insight?</p>
			<p id="id00433">To this particular objection, at any rate, it is easy to reply. In using concepts of his own to discredit the theoretic claims of concepts generally, Bergson does not contradict, but on the contrary emphatically illustrates his own view of their practical role, for they serve in his hands only to “orient” us, to show us to what quarter we must <i>practically turn</i> if we wish to gain that completer insight into reality which he denies that they can give. He directs our hopes away from them and towards the despised sensible flux. <i>What he reaches by their means is thus only a new practical attitude</i>. He but restores, against the vetoes of intellectualist philosophy, our naturally cordial relations with sensible experience and common sense. This service is surely only practical; but it is a service for which we may be almost immeasurably grateful. To trust our senses again with a good philosophic conscience!⁠—who ever conferred on us so valuable a freedom before?</p>
			<p id="id00434">By making certain distinctions and additions it seems easy to meet the other counts of the indictment. Concepts are realities of a new order, with particular relations between them. These relations are just as much directly perceived, when we compare our various concepts, as the distance between two sense-objects is perceived when we look at it. Conception is an operation which gives us material for new acts of perception, then; and when the results of these are written down, we get those bodies of “mental truth” (as Locke called it) known as mathematics, logic, and <i>a priori</i> metaphysics. To know all this truth is a theoretic achievement, indeed, but it is a narrow one; for the relations between conceptual objects as such are only the static ones of bare comparison, as difference or sameness, congruity or contradiction, inclusion or exclusion. Nothing <i>happens</i> in the realm of concepts; relations there are “eternal” only. The theoretic gain fails so far, therefore, to touch even the outer hem of the real world, the world of causal and dynamic relations, of activity and history. To gain insight into all that moving life, Bergson is right in turning us away from conception and towards perception.</p>
			<p id="id00435">By combining concepts with percepts, <i>we can draw maps of the distribution</i> of other percepts in distant space and time. To know this distribution is of course a theoretic achievement, but the achievement is extremely limited, it cannot be effected without percepts, and even then what it yields is only static relations. From maps we learn positions only, and the position of a thing is but the slightest kind of truth about it; but, being indispensable for forming our plans of action, the conceptual map-making has the enormous practical importance on which Bergson so rightly insists.</p>
			<p id="id00436">But concepts, it will be said, do not only give us eternal truths of comparison and maps of the positions of things, they bring new <i>values</i> into life. In their mapping function they stand to perception in general in the same relation in which sight and hearing stand to touch⁠—Spencer calls these higher senses only organs of anticipatory touch. But our eyes and ears also open to us worlds of independent glory: music and decorative art result, and an incredible enhancement of life’s value follows. Even so does the conceptual world bring new ranges of value and of motivation to our life. Its maps not only serve us practically, but the mere mental possession of such vast pictures is of itself an inspiring good. New interests and incitements, and feelings of power, sublimity, and admiration are aroused.</p>
			<p id="id00437">Abstractness <i>per se</i> seems to have a touch of ideality. ROYCE’S “loyalty to loyalty” is an excellent example. “Causes,” as anti-slavery, democracy, liberty, etc., dwindle when realized in their sordid particulars. The veritable “cash-value” of the idea seems to cleave to it only in the abstract status. Truth at large, as ROYCE contends, in his <i>Philosophy of Loyalty</i>, appears another thing altogether from the true particulars in which it is best to believe. It transcends in value all those “expediencies,” and is something to live for, whether expedient or inexpedient. Truth with a big T is a “momentous issue”; truths in detail are “poor scraps,” mere “crumbling successes.” (<i>Op. cit.</i>, Lecture VII, especially § v.)</p>
			<p id="id00438">Is, now, such bringing into existence of a new <i>value</i> to be regarded as a theoretic achievement? The question is a nice one, for altho a value is in one sense an objective quality perceived, the essence of that quality is its relation to the will, and consists in its being a dynamogenic spur that makes our action different. So far as their value-creating function goes, it would thus appear that concepts connect themselves more with our active than with our theoretic life, so here again Bergson’s formulation seems unobjectionable. Persons who have certain concepts are animated otherwise, pursue their own vital careers differently. It doesn’t necessarily follow that they understand other vital careers more intimately.</p>
			<p id="id00439">Again it may be said that we combine old concepts into new ones, conceiving thus such realities as the ether, God, souls, or what not, of which our sensible life alone would leave us altogether ignorant. This surely is an increase of our knowledge, and may well be called a theoretical achievement. Yet here again Bergson’s criticisms hold good. Much as conception may tell us <i>about</i> such invisible objects, it sheds no ray of light into their interior. The completer, indeed, our definitions of ether-waves, atoms, Gods, or souls become, the less instead of the more intelligible do they appear to us. The learned in such things are consequently beginning more and more to ascribe a solely instrumental value to our concepts of them. Ether and molecules may be like co-ordinates and averages, only so many crutches by the help of which we practically perform the operation of getting about among our sensible experiences.</p>
			<p id="id00440">We see from these considerations how easily the question of whether the function of concepts is theoretical or practical may grow into a logomachy. It may be better from this point of view to refuse to recognize the alternative as a sharp one. The sole thing that is certain in the midst of it all is that Bergson is absolutely right in contending that the whole life of activity and change is inwardly impenetrable to conceptual treatment, and that it opens itself only to sympathetic apprehension at the hands of immediate feeling. All the <i>whats</i> as well as the <i>thats</i> of reality, relational as well as terminal, are in the end contents of immediate concrete perception. Yet the remoter unperceived <i>arrangements</i>, temporal, spatial, and logical, of these contents, are also something that we need to know as well for the pleasure of the knowing as for the practical help. We may call this need of arrangement a theoretic need or a practical need, according as we choose to lay the emphasis; but Bergson is accurately right when he limits conceptual knowledge to arrangement, and when he insists that arrangement is the mere skirt and skin of the whole of what we ought to know.</p>

			<p id="id00442">Note 3, page 268.⁠—I have myself talked in other ways as plausibly as I could, in my <i>Psychology</i>, and talked truly (as I believe) in certain selected cases; but for other cases the natural way invincibly comes back.</p>
			<h4 id="id00443" style="margin-top: 2em">LECTURE VII</h4>
			<p id="id00444">Note 1, page 278.⁠—<i>Introduction to Hume</i>, 1874, p. 151.</p>
			<p id="id00445">Note 2, page 279.⁠—<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 16, 21, 36, <i>et passim</i>.</p>

			<p id="id00447">Note 4, page 280.⁠—Compare, as to all this, an article by the present writer, entitled “A world of pure experience,” in the <i>Journal of Philosophy</i>, New York, vol. i, pp. 533, 561 (1905).</p>
			<p id="id00448">Note 5, page 280.⁠—Green’s attempt to discredit sensations by reminding us of their “dumbness,” in that they do not come already <i>named</i>, as concepts may be said to do, only shows how intellectualism is dominated by verbality. The unnamed appears in Green as synonymous with the unreal.</p>
			<p id="id00449">Note 6, page 283.⁠—<i>Philosophy of Reflection</i>, i, 248 ff.</p>
			<p id="id00450">Note 7, page 284.⁠—Most of this paragraph is extracted from an address of mine before the American Psychological Association, printed in the <i>Psychological Review</i>, vol. ii, p. 105. I take pleasure in the fact that already in 1895 I was so far advanced towards my present bergsonian position.</p>
			<p id="id00451">Note 8, page 289.⁠—The conscious self of the moment, the central self, is probably determined to this privileged position by its functional connexion with the body’s imminent or present acts. It is the present <i>acting</i> self. Tho the more that surrounds it may be “subconscious” to us, yet if in its “collective capacity” it also exerts an active function, it may be conscious in a wider way, conscious, as it were, over our heads.</p>
			<p id="id00452">On the relations of consciousness to action see Bergson’s <i>Matière et Mémoire, passim</i>, especially chap. i. Compare also the hints in Münsterberg’s <i>Grundzüge der Psychologie</i>, chap, xv; those in my own <i>Principles of Psychology</i>, vol. ii, pp. 581⁠–⁠592; and those in W. McDougall’s <i>Physiological Psychology</i>, chap. vii.</p>
